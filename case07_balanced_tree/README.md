## üéØ My Solution
*View the complete syntax [here](https://github.com/pedropalmier/8-week-sql-challenge/blob/b84caab5db93cc00dea9500f779837babaa8283e/case07_balanced_tree/solution.sql).*

> üí¨ **Note**
> - *In this case study schema, `price` is assumed to be the unit price per product and `discount` is assumed to be a percentage (0-1). All queries and calculations are based on these assumptions since the dataset does not clearly define these fields.*
> - *Revenue is understood as gross amount minus `discount`.*
