## üíé Business Context 
Pizza Runner is a pizza delivery startup that uses contracted runners and a mobile ordering app. See the original case study [here](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-2/).


## ‚ö°Ô∏èProblem Statement
Danny needs help to apply core calculations to better direct runners and optimize Pizza Runner's operations. He began collecting data to support the startup's growth and designed the below entity relationship diagram for the database. See the original schema [here](https://github.com/pedropalmier/8-week-sql-challenge/blob/c0aa498043bdfefe8207e5d8771ed2fdd1388aa9/case02_pizza_runner/schema.sql).

However, before meaningful analysis can be performed, the datasets in the `pizza_runner` schema require significant cleaning and preparation. In the `customer_orders` table, the columns `exclusions` and `extras` contain string representations of missing values such as 'NaN', ' ', and 'null'. They also store multiple values in a single row:

| order_id | customer_id | pizza_id | exclusions | extras | order_time           |
|:----------|:-------------|:----------|:------------|:--------|:----------------------|
| 1        | 101         | 1        |            |        | 2021-01-01 18:05:02 |

For the `runner_orders` table, `pickup_time`, `distance`, `duration`, and `cancellation` also contained string representations of missing values, and the first two additionally had non-standardized measurement units:


| order_id | runner_id | pickup_time          | distance | duration    | cancellation             |
|:----------|:-----------|:----------------------|:----------|:-------------|:--------------------------|

Lastly, the `pizza_recipes` table contained multiple values in a single row too:
| pizza_id | toppings               |
|:----------|:-------------------------|
| 1        | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10 |

### Section 0: Data Cleansing Steps
<a id="01"></a>
#### 01. Make the necessary adjustments and clean the database to answer the questions in the best way.   
> - *For cleaning and standardization of the `customer_orders` amd `runner_orders` tables, and normalization of the `pizza_recipes` table, I created new ones instead of overwriting the originals to preserve records, simulating a real version control scenario.*
> - *Additionally, to better handle the multi-valued fields in the `exclusions` and `extras` columns of the `customer_orders` table, I created two new tables with these values normalized.*

```sql
-- Cleaning customer_orders table
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS customer_orders_cleaned;
CREATE TABLE customer_orders_cleaned AS

       customer_id,

#### D3. The Pizza Runner team now wants to add an additional ratings system that allows customers to rate their runner, how would you design an additional table for this new dataset - generate a schema for this new table and insert your own data for ratings for each successful customer order between 1 to 5.

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS pizza_runner.runner_rating;
CREATE TABLE pizza_runner.runner_rating
(
    order_id    INTEGER,
    runner_id   INTEGER,
    customer_id INTEGER,
    rating      INTEGER,
    CONSTRAINT fk_order
        FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES runner_orders_cleaned (order_id),
    CONSTRAINT fk_runner
        FOREIGN KEY (runner_id) REFERENCES runners (runner_id)
);

INSERT INTO pizza_runner.runner_rating (order_id, runner_id, customer_id, rating)
SELECT ro.order_id,
       ro.runner_id,
       MIN(co.customer_id)          AS customer_id,
       FLOOR(RANDOM() * 5 + 1)::INT AS rating
FROM runner_orders_cleaned ro
         JOIN customer_orders_cleaned co
              ON co.order_id = ro.order_id
WHERE ro.cancellation IS NULL
GROUP BY ro.order_id, ro.runner_id
ORDER BY ro.order_id;
```

| order\_id | runner\_id | customer\_id | rating |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | 1 | 101 | 3 |
| 2 | 1 | 101 | 1 |
| 3 | 1 | 102 | 5 |
| 4 | 2 | 103 | 3 |
| 5 | 3 | 104 | 2 |
| 7 | 2 | 105 | 2 |
| 8 | 2 | 102 | 5 |
| 10 | 1 | 104 | 1 |

#### D4. Using your newly generated table - can you join all of the information together to form a table which has the following information for successful deliveries?
- **`customer_id`**
- **`order_id`**
- **`runner_id`**
- **`rating`**
- **`order_time`**
- **`pickup_time`**
- **Time between order and pickup**
- **Delivery duration**
- **Average speed**
- **Total number of pizzas**

```sql
SELECT rr.customer_id,
       rr.order_id,
       rr.runner_id,
       rr.rating,
       c.order_time,
       ro.pickup_time,
       EXTRACT(MINUTE FROM (ro.pickup_time - c.order_time)) AS minutes_to_pickup,
       ro.duration                                          AS delivery_duration,
       ROUND((ro.distance / (ro.duration / 60.0)), 2)       AS avg_speed_kmph,
       COUNT(c.pizza_id)                                    AS total_pizzas
FROM runner_rating rr
         LEFT JOIN customer_orders_cleaned c ON c.order_id = rr.order_id
         LEFT JOIN runner_orders_cleaned ro ON ro.order_id = rr.order_id
GROUP BY rr.customer_id,
         rr.order_id,
         rr.runner_id,
         rr.rating,
         c.order_time,
         ro.pickup_time, minutes_to_pickup, delivery_duration, avg_speed_kmph
ORDER BY rr.order_id;
```

#### D5. If a Meat Lovers pizza was $12 and Vegetarian $10 fixed prices with no cost for extras and each runner is paid $0.30 per kilometre traveled - how much money does Pizza Runner have left over after these deliveries?


```sql
WITH coust_per_order AS (SELECT c.order_id,
                                SUM(
                                        CASE WHEN c.pizza_id = 1 THEN 12 ELSE 10 END
                                )                 AS cost,
                                ro.distance * 0.3 AS runner_paid
                         FROM runner_orders_cleaned ro
                                  INNER JOIN customer_orders_cleaned c ON c.order_id = ro.order_id
                         WHERE ro.cancellation IS NULL
                         GROUP BY c.order_id, runner_paid)

SELECT SUM(cost - runner_paid) AS total_profit
FROM coust_per_order;
```

### Section E: Bonus Question

#### E1. If Danny wants to expand his range of pizzas - how would this impact the existing data design? Write an `INSERT` statement to demonstrate what would happen if a new `Supreme` pizza with all the toppings was added to the Pizza Runner menu?


```sql
INSERT INTO pizza_runner.pizza_names (pizza_id, pizza_name)
VALUES (3, 'Supreme');

INSERT INTO pizza_runner.pizza_recipes_unnested (pizza_id, topping_id)
SELECT 3, topping_id
FROM pizza_runner.pizza_toppings;

INSERT INTO pizza_runner.pizza_recipes (pizza_id, toppings)
SELECT 3, string_agg(topping_id::text, ', ')
FROM pizza_runner.pizza_toppings;
```

| pizza\_id | pizza\_name |
