## üíé Business Context
Danny‚Äôs Diner is a small japanese restaurant that opened at the start of 2021. The menu offers three simple dishes: sushi, curry, and ramen. See the original case study statement [here](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-1/).

## ‚ö°Ô∏èProblem Statement
Danny needed support to analyze customer behavior using the limited data he had collected over time. The relationship diagram below illustrates the three core tables used in this case. See the original schema [here](https://github.com/pedropalmier/8-week-sql-challenge/blob/c0aa498043bdfefe8207e5d8771ed2fdd1388aa9/case01_dannys_diner/schema.sql).

## ‚ùìCase Study Questions
### Section A: Case Study Questions
1. [What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?](#a1)
2. [How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?](#a2)
3. [What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?](#a3)
4. [What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?](#a4)
5. [Which item was the most popular for each customer?](#a5)
6. [Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?](#a6)
7. [Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?](#a7)
8. [What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?](#a8)
9. [If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?](#a9)
10. [In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?](#a10)
### Section B: Bonus Questions
1. [Create a table with `customer_id`, `order_date`, `product_name`, `price`, `member` (Y/N)](#b1)
2. [Ranking of products purchased by each customer after they became a member, showing `NULL` ranking values for non-member purchases](#b2)

<a id="a1"></a>
#### A1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?

```sql
SELECT s.customer_id,
       SUM(m.price) AS total_amount
FROM sales s
         INNER JOIN
     menu m ON s.product_id = m.product_id
GROUP BY s.customer_id
ORDER BY total_amount DESC;
```

| customer\_id | total\_amount |
| ------------ | ------------- |
| A            | 76            |
| B            | 74            |
| C            | 36            |

<a id="a2"></a>
#### A2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?


```sql
SELECT s.customer_id,
       COUNT(DISTINCT s.order_date) AS visit_count
FROM sales s
GROUP BY s.customer_id
ORDER BY visit_count DESC;
```

| customer\_id | visit\_count |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| B            | 6            |
| A            | 4            |
| C            | 2            |

<a id="a3"></a>
#### A3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?

> üí¨ **Notes**
> - *Multiple same-day purchases require deterministic ranking - using product_id ASC to ensure consistent results across database environments and avoid arbitrary ties*
> - *Deterministic tiebreaking critical for reliable customer journey analysis*


```sql
WITH first_purchase AS (SELECT s.customer_id,
                               m.product_id,
                               m.product_name,
                               s.order_date,
                               RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY
                                   s.order_date, s.product_id) AS rank
                        FROM sales s
                                 JOIN
                             menu m ON s.product_id = m.product_id)
SELECT customer_id,
       product_name,
       order_date
FROM first_purchase
WHERE rank = 1
ORDER BY order_date;
```

| customer\_id | product\_name | order\_date |
| ------------ | ------------- | ----------- |
| A            | sushi         | 2021-01-01  |
| B            | curry         | 2021-01-01  |
| C            | ramen         | 2021-01-01  |

<a id="a4"></a>
#### A4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?

```sql
WITH purchase_counts AS (SELECT m.product_name,
                                COUNT(*)                             AS purchase_count,
                                RANK() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS rank
                         FROM menu m
                                  INNER JOIN
                              sales s ON m.product_id = s.product_id
                         GROUP BY m.product_id, m.product_name)

SELECT product_name, purchase_count, rank
FROM purchase_counts
WHERE rank = 1;
```

| product\_name | purchase\_count | rank |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ramen | 8 | 1 |

<a id="a5"></a>
#### A5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?
> üí¨ **Notes**
> - *RANK() handles ties properly - customers with equal purchase counts get same rank*
> - *Preserves all tied preferences rather than arbitrary selection via ROW_NUMBER*
> - *Edge Case: customer B shows 3-way tie (sushi/curry/ramen), all ranked #1 - intentional behavior*

```sql
WITH item_rank AS (SELECT s.customer_id,
                          m.product_name,
                          COUNT(s.product_id)                                                        AS purchase_count,
                          RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY COUNT(s.product_id) DESC) AS popularity_rank
                   FROM sales s
                            INNER JOIN
                        menu m ON s.product_id = m.product_id
                   GROUP BY s.customer_id, s.product_id, m.product_name)

SELECT customer_id,
       product_name,
       purchase_count
FROM item_rank
WHERE popularity_rank = 1;
```

| customer\_id | product\_name | purchase\_count |
| ------------ | ------------- | --------------- |
| A            | ramen         | 3               |

```sql
