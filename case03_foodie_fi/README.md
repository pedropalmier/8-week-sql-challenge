## üíé Business Context 
Danny launched Foodie-Fi in 2020 as a subscription streaming service focused exclusively on food content, offering monthly and annual plans for unlimited access. See the original case study [here](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-3/).

## ‚ö°Ô∏èProblem Statement
Danny needs help to analyze subscription data to generate insights that guide growth, investments, and feature development. This is the entity relationship diagram he shared. See the original schema [here](https://github.com/pedropalmier/8-week-sql-challenge/blob/c0aa498043bdfefe8207e5d8771ed2fdd1388aa9/case03_foodie_fi/schema.sql).

### Section A: Customer Journey

<a id="a1"></a>
#### A1. Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief description about each customer‚Äôs onboarding journey. Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!

> *Bringing the brief of each customer‚Äôs onboarding journey through the following table. Assumption: `acquisition_date` = first subscription date (trial start) and `activation_date` = first paid plan start date (plans 1‚Äì3).*


```sql
SELECT
    s.customer_id,
    MIN(s.start_date) AS acquisition_date,
    MIN(CASE WHEN s.plan_id BETWEEN 1 AND 3 THEN s.start_date END) AS activation_date,
    ARRAY_TO_STRING(ARRAY_AGG(p.plan_name ORDER BY s.start_date), ' ‚Üí ') AS plan_journey,
    MAX(CASE WHEN s.plan_id = 4 THEN s.start_date END) AS churn_date
FROM subscriptions s
JOIN plans p ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
WHERE s.customer_id IN (1, 2, 11, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19)
GROUP BY s.customer_id
ORDER BY s.customer_id;
```

| customer\_id | acquisition\_date | activation\_date | plan\_journey | churn\_date |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | 2020-08-01 | 2020-08-08 | trial ‚Üí basic monthly | null |

### Section B: Data Analysis Questions

<a id="b1"></a>
#### B1: How many customers has Foodie-Fi ever had?

```sql
SELECT TRIM(TO_CHAR(DATE_TRUNC('month', s.start_date), 'YYYY Month')) AS month,
       SUM(CASE WHEN s.plan_id = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)                 AS trial_plans_starts

#### B3: What plan `start_date` values occur after the year 2020 for our dataset? Show the breakdown by count of events for each `plan_name`.

```sql
SELECT p.plan_name,
       COUNT(s.start_date) AS plans_after_2020

#### B4: What is the customer count and percentage of customers who have churned rounded to 1 decimal place?

> üí¨ **Note** 
> - *Churn defined as the last plan (`plan_id `= `4`). Query isolates each customer‚Äôs final plan to avoid double counting and ensure churn is measured at customer level, designed to be robust even if future datasets contain intermediate churn events.*

```sql

#### B7: What is the customer count and percentage breakdown of all 5 plan_name values at `2020-12-31`?

#### B8: How many customers have upgraded to an annual plan in 2020?

> üí¨ **Note**
> - *Current dataset always starts with trial, so any pro annual in 2020 is an upgrade. However, if direct annual sign-ups existed, they would not count. This universal query ensures only true upgrades are returned.*

### Section C: Challenge Payment Question

<a id="c1"></a>
#### C1: The Foodie-Fi team wants you to create a new `payments` table for the year 2020 that includes amounts paid by each customer in the `subscriptions` table with the following requirements:
- **monthly payments always occur on the same day of month as the original `start_date` of any monthly paid plan**
- **upgrades from basic to monthly or pro plans are reduced by the current paid amount in that month and start immediately**
- **upgrades from pro monthly to pro annual are paid at the end of the current billing period and also starts at the end of the month period**
- **once a customer churns they will no longer make payments**

**Example outputs for this table might look like the following:**

| customer_id | plan_id | plan_name     | payment_date | amount | payment_order |
|-------------|---------|---------------|--------------|--------|---------------|
| 1           | 1       | basic monthly | 2020-08-08   | 9.90   | 1             |

### Section D: Outside The Box Questions

<a id="d1"></a>
##### D1: How would you calculate the rate of growth for Foodie-Fi?

> *I would define growth in two complementary ways: customer growth rate and revenue growth rate.*
> *For the customer growth rate, I would measure the variation in the number of active paying customers in a given period divided by the total customer base at the start of that period. This indicates whether the business is expanding or contracting its paying user base.*
> *For the revenue growth rate, I would apply the same logic but using values related to new paid sign-ups, upgrades, downgrades, and churn (ARR/MRR movements). This shows the financial health of the business.*
> *It is important to analyze both in parallel because growth in one aspect does not necessarily mean growth in the other. For example, revenue growth may come from the same customer base upgrading to higher-value plans rather than from acquiring new paying customers.*

<a id="d2"></a>
##### D2: What key metrics would you recommend Foodie-Fi management to track over time to assess performance of their overall business?

> *If the company is in an early stage (prioritizing acquisition and growth), and interpreting the dataset it seems to be the case, I would recommend Foodie-Fi to focus mainly on trial-to-paid conversion rate and time-to-convert. These metrics show how well the activation strategy is working and whether the business is moving toward proving product-market fit.*
> *If the company is in a scale-up phase, I would suggest tracking MRR/ARR growth and churn rate to evaluate how healthy that growth really is.*
> *Finally, in a mature stage, I would prioritize Net Revenue Retention (NRR) and the LTV:CAC ratio to assess predictability and acquisition efficiency. As a benchmark, an NRR consistently above 100% is usually a sign of a very strong subscription business.*

<a id="d3"></a>
##### D3: What are some key customer journeys or experiences that you would analyse further to improve customer retention?

> *I would first focus on tracking the observable customer journeys in the data, such as trial, upgrade, downgrade, and churn paths. Then I would cross-reference these outcomes with qualitative experience metrics like NPS, CSAT, and CES to gain a more complete view of potential causes and effects behind retention or attrition.*

<a id="d4"></a>
##### D4: If the Foodie-Fi team were to create an exit survey shown to customers who wish to cancel their subscription, what questions would you include in the survey?

> *The question should be multiple choice with an ‚ÄúOther‚Äù option to capture anything unexpected. A clear phrasing could be:*
> > ***What is the main reason you decided to cancel your Foodie-Fi subscription?***
> > 1. [ ] *I don‚Äôt use it enough to justify the cost (captures low engagement)*
> > 2. [ ] *I found a better service (identifies competitive pressure)*
> > 3. [ ] *Not enough variety or relevance in the content (highlights dissatisfaction with value)*
> > 4. [ ] *The platform was difficult to use (points to usability issues)*
> > 5. [ ] *I experienced technical problems (signals product reliability gaps)*
> > 6. [ ] *Other [please specify] (leaves room for unanticipated reasons)*

<a id="d5"></a>
##### D5: What business levers could the Foodie-Fi team use to reduce the customer churn rate? How would you validate the effectiveness of your ideas?

> *Churn is the ultimate lagging indicator, but I would validate levers early through leading metrics like engagement frequency, return time, content completion, and support tickets. By reason:*
> - *Too expensive / low usage ‚Äì flexible pricing or pause options and track login frequency.*
> - *Found a better service ‚Äì exclusive content or partnerships and track adoption of new offerings.*
> - *Lack of variety/relevance ‚Äì more releases, personalization and track content depth.*
> - *Difficult to use ‚Äì onboarding and UX improvements and track drop-off rates.*
> - *Technical problems ‚Äì faster bug fixing and QA and track support volume.*
