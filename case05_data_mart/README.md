## üíé Business Context 
Danny launched Data Mart, an online supermarket specializing in fresh produce, and introduced sustainable packaging across the supply chain in June 2020. See the original case study [here](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-5/).

## ‚ö°Ô∏èProblem Statement
Danny needs help to measure the sales impact of the sustainability changes and identify the most affected platforms, regions, segments, and customer types. He and the Data Mart team prepared only one table. See the original schema [here](https://github.com/pedropalmier/8-week-sql-challenge/blob/c0aa498043bdfefe8207e5d8771ed2fdd1388aa9/case05_data_mart/schema.sql).

### Section A: Data Cleansing Steps

<a id="a1"></a>
#### A1: In a single query, perform the following operations and generate a new table in the `data_mart` schema named `clean_weekly_sales`:

- **Convert the `week_date` to a `DATE` format**
- **Add a `week_number` as the second column for each `week_date` value, for example any value from the 1st of January to 7th of January will be 1, 8th to 14th will be 2 etc**
- **Add a `month_number` with the calendar month for each `week_date` value as the 3rd column**
- **Add a `calendar_year` column as the 4th column containing either 2018, 2019 or 2020 values**
- **Add a new column called `age_band` after the original `segment` column using the following mapping on the number inside the `segment` value:**

| segment | age_band     |
|---------|--------------|
| 1       | Young Adults |
| 2       | Middle Aged  |
| 3 or 4  | Retirees     |

- **Add a new `demographic` column using the following mapping for the first letter in the `segment` values:**

| segment | demographic |
|---------|-------------|
| C       | Couples     |
| F       | Families    |

- **Ensure all `null` string values with an `"unknown"` string value in the original `segment` column as well as the new `age_band` and `demographic` columns**
- **Generate a new `avg_transaction` column as the `sales` value divided by `transactions` rounded to 2 decimal places for each record**
