## üíé Business Context 
Danny founded Clique Bait, an online seafood store, combining his background in digital data analytics with the seafood industry. See the original case study [here](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-6/).

## ‚ö°Ô∏èProblem Statement
Danny needs help to analyze store data and calculate funnel fallout rates to support his business vision. He prepared a total of 5 datasets that need to be combined to answer the questions. See the original schema [here](https://github.com/pedropalmier/8-week-sql-challenge/blob/b84caab5db93cc00dea9500f779837babaa8283e/case06_clique_bait/schema.sql).
