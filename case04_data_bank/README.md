## üíé Business Context 
Danny launched Data Bank, a digital-only bank that links customer account balances to secure distributed data storage limits. See the original case study [here](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-4/).


## ‚ö°Ô∏èProblem Statement
Danny needs help to analyze customer and storage data to forecast demand and support business growth. He and the Data Bank team prepared this entity relationship diagram. See the original schema [here](https://github.com/pedropalmier/8-week-sql-challenge/blob/c0aa498043bdfefe8207e5d8771ed2fdd1388aa9/case04_data_bank/schema.sql).

### Section A: Customer Nodes Exploration

<a id="a1"></a>
#### A1: How many unique nodes are there on the Data Bank system?


```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT node_id) AS unique_nodes
FROM customer_nodes;
```

| unique\_nodes |
| :--- |
| 5 |


<a id="a2"></a>
#### A2: What is the number of nodes per region?

> üí¨ **Note**
> - Number of nodes *is ambiguous. It can mean total assignments (`COUNT`) or unique nodes per region (`COUNT DISTINCT`). This query counts total assignments, but `COUNT(DISTINCT node_id)` may be more accurate for active infrastructure analysis.*

```sql
SELECT region_id, COUNT(DISTINCT node_id) AS nodes_count
FROM customer_nodes
GROUP BY region_id
ORDER BY nodes_count DESC;
```

| region\_id | nodes\_count |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1 | 5 |
| 2 | 5 |
| 3 | 5 |
| 4 | 5 |
| 5 | 5 |


<a id="a3"></a>
#### A3: How many customers are allocated to each region?

```sql
SELECT r.region_name,
       COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS customer_count
FROM customer_nodes c
         INNER JOIN regions r ON r.region_id = c.region_id
GROUP BY r.region_name
ORDER BY customer_count DESC;
```

| region\_name | customer\_count |
| :--- | :--- |
| Australia | 110 |
| America | 105 |
| Africa | 102 |
| Asia | 95 |
| Europe | 88 |


<a id="a4"></a>
#### A4: How many days on average are customers reallocated to a different node?

> üí¨ **Note**
> - *The dataset uses `9999-12-31` to represent an open allocation (still active). Although not explicit in the case text, this interpretation was assumed for the calculation.*

```sql
WITH node_days AS (SELECT c2.customer_id,
                          node_id,
                          (c2.end_date - c2.start_date) AS days_in_node
                   FROM customer_nodes c2
                   WHERE c2.end_date != '9999-12-31'),

     total_node_days AS (SELECT customer_id,
                                node_id,
                                SUM(days_in_node) as total_days
                         FROM node_days
                         GROUP BY customer_id, node_id)

SELECT ROUND(AVG(total_days), 0) AS avg_days_in_node
FROM total_node_days;
```

| avg\_days\_in\_node |
| :--- |
| 24 |


<a id="a5"></a>
#### A5: What is the median, 80th and 95th percentile for this same reallocation days metric for each region?

```sql
WITH region_days AS (SELECT region_id,
                            (end_date - start_date) AS days_in_node
                     FROM customer_nodes
                     WHERE end_date != '9999-12-31')

SELECT rd.region_id,
       r.region_name,
       PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY days_in_node)  AS median,
       PERCENTILE_CONT(0.8) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY days_in_node)  AS p80,
       PERCENTILE_CONT(0.95) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY days_in_node) AS p95
FROM region_days rd
         INNER JOIN regions r ON rd.region_id = r.region_id
GROUP BY rd.region_id, r.region_name;
```

| region\_id | region\_name | median | p80 | p95 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Australia | 15 | 23 | 28 |
| 2 | America | 15 | 23 | 28 |

| 4 | Asia | 15 | 23 | 28 |
| 5 | Europe | 15 | 24 | 28 |

### Section B: Customer Transactions

#### B1: What is the unique count and total amount for each transaction type?

```sql
SELECT ct.txn_type,
       COUNT(ct.txn_type) AS unique_count,
       SUM(ct.txn_amount) AS total_amount
FROM customer_transactions ct
GROUP BY ct.txn_type

                        GROUP BY ct.customer_id)

SELECT ROUND(AVG(unique_count), 0) AS avg_total_deposit,
       ROUND(AVG(total_amount), 2) AS avg_total_amount

<a id="b3"></a>
#### B3: For each month - how many Data Bank customers make more than 1 deposit and either 1 purchase or 1 withdrawal in a single month?


```sql
WITH txn_count AS (SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', txn_date)                              AS month_date,
                          TRIM(TO_CHAR(DATE_TRUNC('month', txn_date), 'YYYY Month')) AS month,
                          customer_id,
                          SUM(CASE WHEN txn_type = 'deposit' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)      AS deposit_count,

SELECT month,
       COUNT(customer_id)
FROM txn_count
WHERE deposit_count > 1
  AND (purchase_count >= 1 OR withdrawal_count >= 1)
GROUP BY month, month_date
ORDER BY month_date;
```
